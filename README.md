COVID-19, also known as Corona Virus Disease, has been declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO). As the death rate and infection rate began to increase, people have started to show mixed feelings regarding this situation. Currently, millions of
people are actively using social media platforms which leads to millions of tweets being tweeted
every day. People share their daily lives through messages on platforms such as Twitter. In the
proposed work, Twitter-based sentiment analysis is done. The goal of this work is to present
a domain-specific approach to understanding sentiments reflected within people regarding this
situation. To attain this, COVID-19-specific tweets are collected. Raw tweets contain a lot
of noise and require to be pre-processed before feature extraction to get cleaned tweets. The
tweets are then labeled using VADER. The proposed method consists of two approaches, supervised machine learning, and deep learning. The machine learning approach uses TFIDF for feature vector creation then Naive Bayes and Random Forest are used for sentiment
classification. The second approach uses GloVe Pre-trained word vectors that represent a
feature vector of the tweet. It is then fed to the Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) network
to process the input sequentially. Further, two approaches were compared to identify the
best method that gives higher accuracy on this COVID-19 dataset. It is shown that deep
learning models perform better on the COVID-19 dataset than traditional models.
